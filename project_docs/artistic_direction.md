🎨 Artistic Direction
1. Brand Essence

ALD by Elite is a symbol of luxury, serenity, and coastal modernity.
The brand evokes:

Prestige & Elegance — every space exudes refinement, calm, and exclusivity.

Oceanic Serenity — proximity to the Atlantic inspires fluid lines, open light, and natural tones.

Architectural Excellence — the design language is modern, with minimalist and geometric precision.

The website should feel timeless, sophisticated, and immersive — more like a boutique real estate experience than a traditional corporate site.

🖼️ Visual & UI Design
1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

Concept: “Entre l’océan et le haut de gamme, il n’y a qu’un pas.”
Use a cinematic 3D render or slow-motion video background showing:

Gentle light over the Almadies coast,

Architectural details (glass, marble, palm reflections),

Possibly a moving aerial shot of the building façade.

Hero layout:

Minimal navbar (transparent over hero, later turns solid white).

Center-aligned title:

Résidence ALD
Entre l’Océan et le Haut de Gamme

CTA buttons:

“Découvrir la Résidence”

“Réserver une visite privée”

2. Color Palette
Type	Color	Meaning
Primary	#0A0A0A (Charcoal Black)	Elegance, timeless luxury
Secondary	#C1A471 (Gold Beige)	Prestige, warmth
Accent	#005A70 (Deep Ocean Blue)	Coastal depth
Light Base	#F5F4F2 (Sand White)	Clean sophistication
Highlight	#E3D9C6 (Marble Cream)	Architectural material tone

The overall look should be monochrome with warm gold accents and subtle blue undertones to recall the ocean proximity.

3. Typography
Use	Font	Style
Headings	Playfair Display	Classic luxury serif (refined, confident)
Body Text	Inter or Lato	Minimalist, legible sans-serif
Accents / Subtitles	Cormorant Garamond Italic	Optional for elegance and flow

All text spacing should feel airy. Avoid heavy blocks of text — think “architectural brochure”.

4. Photography & Imagery

Use high-resolution lifestyle imagery (sunlit interiors, marble textures, reflections, ocean horizon).

Consistent soft lighting — slightly warm, golden hour hues.

Avoid overexposed whites; favor gentle contrast and natural brightness.

Integrate architectural blueprints or minimalist line art as section dividers.

5. Layout & Structure
Section	Purpose	Visual Feel
Hero	Immersive first impression	Motion background, elegant typography
About the Residence	Present ALD’s identity	Split layout: text on one side, slow panning building video or render
Interiors	Highlight craftsmanship	Image grid of rooms (living room, kitchen, bedroom) with minimal captions
Amenities	Showcase lifestyle	Horizontal scroll of visuals (pool, gym, spa, cinema, crèche)
Architecture Plans	Transparency & detail	Light grey background, blueprint overlay
Neighborhood (Les Almadies)	Sell the location	Aerial map + elegant text + local photography
Contact / Visit	Lead capture	Clean form + contact info + map embed

Each section should flow like a magazine spread, using parallax scrolling, fade reveals, and smooth transitions (Framer Motion / GSAP).

6. Interactions

Subtle scroll-triggered reveals (opacity + upward motion).

Luxury-grade cursor hover effects — e.g., image zoom or gold underline on hover.

Smooth page transitions with fade-to-white or black screens.

🪞 Tone of Voice & Copywriting

Elegant, sensory, and aspirational French with subtle English infusions:

Avoid sales jargon.

Use rhythm, contrast, and imagery.

Example:

Un horizon d’élégance.
Nichée à quelques encablures de l’Atlantique, la Résidence ALD redéfinit l’art de vivre entre prestige, confort et sérénité.

Keep sentences short, evocative, and tactile — readers should “feel” the marble, the air, the light.
